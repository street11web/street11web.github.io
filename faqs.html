				<p sx={normalText}>
					Street 11 currently supports only signing in using Google. So, Street 11 accounts do not have
                    a separate username and password. Accounts are identified using email addresses provided while signing in using Google.

				<h3 sx={smallHeadingText}>What happens to my page after my account is deleted?</h3>
